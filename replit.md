## Overview

IBX is a real-time chat application built with a modern full-stack architecture. The application provides Discord-like functionality with multiple themed chat rooms, file sharing capabilities, user presence indicators, and a responsive design with custom gradient branding. Users can register with usernames and profile images, join different themed chat rooms, send text messages and files (up to 20 files at once, 50MB each), and see who's currently online. The application features a pastel blue-to-pink gradient design theme and streamlined interface without admin management controls.
